Simple Linear Regression 
    ->Linear Regression is a linear apporximation of a causal relationship
    -between two or more variables
    - Dependent Var-Y (being predicted)
    - Indepent Var-X ...[X1,X2,...,Xk] (predictors)
    - Y = F(X1,X2,...,Xk) -> Y is a function of independent vars x1 to xk
    -the Regr model is a linear approx of this function ^
    - γ = β0 + β1ϰ1 + ε -> y-dependent x-independent
